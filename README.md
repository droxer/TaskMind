# TaskMind
TaskMind is an iOS-focused productivity app built with Expo, React Native, and TypeScript. Capture big goals, let GenAI suggest a breakdown into actionable tasks, or add tasks manually with priorities and due dates that stay in sync via iCloud.

## Features
- Break goals into suggested subtasks with adjustable priorities and due dates.
- Capture manual tasks quickly with inline priority and schedule controls.
- Stay organised across Home, Goals, and Calendar views with iCloud-ready sync.

## Setup
Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) if it is not already available on your machine, then run:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```
Launch the Expo project on an iOS simulator or device signed in to iCloud to explore the experience.
